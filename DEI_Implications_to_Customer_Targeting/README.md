# DEI Implications to Customer Targeting

The challenges and opportunities represented by new standards of addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion impact all consumer marketing today.

**Diversity** is the presence of differences that may include race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, language, differences in abilities, age, religious commitment, or political perspectives: populations that have been—and remain—under-represented among practitioners in the field and marginalized in the broader society.

## Assignment:

Select one aspect of DEI and analyze its impact on marketing strategy and target audience selection in a country of your choice. Cite at least one specific example.

Include references to the prevailing cultural attitudes to the selected DEI category, and how these either help or hinder broader societal acceptance of the DEI category.


### (Example Assignment) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in Indian Consumer Marketing: Focus on Gender

Consumer marketing in today's era is constantly evolving, grappling with the multifaceted challenges and possibilities that arise from a renewed global focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Across sectors, inclusivity has become an imperative rather than a choice. Amidst this landscape, India, with its rich cultural tapestry, presents a unique intersection of tradition and modernity.

**Gender** is one of the most pertinent aspects of DEI, especially in the Indian context. It's not just about male or female; it's about acknowledging and representing the whole spectrum of gender identities, which includes the hijra community (a traditional third gender community in South Asia), among others.

#### Impact on Marketing Strategy & Target Audience Selection:

Over the past few years, we've observed a pronounced shift in how brands market their products in India, especially in relation to gender. Previously, advertisements were replete with gender stereotypes. For instance, women were predominantly shown in domestic roles while men were depicted as breadwinners.

However, as awareness around gender inclusivity increased, brands started to pivot. Take, for example, the groundbreaking advertisement campaign by **Tanishq**, a leading jewelry brand in India. In 2013, they showcased a beautiful ad featuring a single mother's wedding, challenging the prevailing norms and received a mostly positive response from a progressive segment of the audience.

#### Prevailing Cultural Attitudes:

While urban centers in India, like Mumbai and Bangalore, exhibit more liberal attitudes towards gender, many parts of the country are still rooted in traditional beliefs. It's a dichotomous society where progressive thoughts coexist with deep-rooted patriarchal norms.

Yet, the winds of change are blowing. The younger generation is increasingly questioning age-old beliefs, thanks in part to increased access to global content and education. The landmark judgment by the Supreme Court of India in 2018 decriminalizing homosexuality was a significant step forward in the fight for gender rights.

However, brands also need to tread carefully. A blanket approach doesn't work. While it's essential to challenge regressive norms, it's equally crucial to be sensitive to the local culture and sentiments. Any marketing strategy in India needs to strike a delicate balance.

#### Broader Societal Acceptance:

The more brands promote gender inclusivity, the more it contributes to the broader societal discourse. Every advertisement that breaks a stereotype, every campaign that promotes equality, adds to the narrative. But it's a two-way street. Brands can drive societal change, and at the same time, they need to listen and evolve based on society's feedback.

While the journey towards complete gender inclusivity is long and fraught with challenges, the very fact that we're moving in the right direction is reason enough to be optimistic.
