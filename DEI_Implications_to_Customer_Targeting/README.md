The challenges and opportunities represented by new standards of addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion impact all consumer marketing today.

**Diversity** is the presence of differences that may include race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, language, differences in abilities, age, religious commitment, or political perspectives: populations that have been—and remain—under-represented among practitioners in the field and marginalized in the broader society.

## Assignment:

Select one aspect of DEI and analyze its impact on marketing strategy and target audience selection in a country of your choice. Cite at least one specific example.

Include references to the prevailing cultural attitudes to the selected DEI category, and how these either help or hinder broader societal acceptance of the DEI category.
