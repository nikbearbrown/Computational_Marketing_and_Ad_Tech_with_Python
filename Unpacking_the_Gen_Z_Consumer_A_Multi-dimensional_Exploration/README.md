#### Key Engagement Strategies with Gen Z:

1. **User-Centered Content Creation**: TikTok's primary appeal is its platform, which encourages user-generated content. This resonates with Gen Z, a generation that values self-expression and creativity.

3. **Cultural Movements**: From dance challenges to social activism, TikTok has been a hub for cultural trends. Gen Z users often turn to TikTok to stay updated with what's trending.
4. **Inclusivity**: TikTok provides a platform for diverse voices. Its users come from various backgrounds, and it's not uncommon to see content in different languages, catering to different cultures and communities.
5. **Collaborations and Influencers**: The platform has seen the rise of TikTok-specific influencers, many of whom belong to Gen Z. These influencers play a pivotal role in driving engagement and trends on the platform.

#### Key Engagement Strategies with Gen Z:

1. **Authentic Marketing**: Glossier emphasizes real beauty, often showcasing models and customers with diverse skin types, imperfections, and little to no makeup. This approach stands in stark contrast to heavily retouched images commonly seen in the beauty industry, aligning more with Gen Z's preference for authenticity.
2. **Community Engagement**: The brand actively engages with its community on social platforms like Instagram, collecting feedback and involving them in product development.
3. **Sustainable and Ethical Practices**: Gen Z is particularly conscious about sustainability and ethical production. Glossier's commitment to these values, from packaging to production, appeals greatly to this demographic.

5. **Pop-Up Experiences**: Glossier has created unique pop-up shops and experiential retail spaces that go beyond traditional shopping, offering Gen Z a tangible brand experience.
6. **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Encouraging users to share their beauty routines and testimonials, Glossier often reposts UGC on their platforms. This not only gives a sense of community but also offers genuine reviews to potential customers.
7. **Inclusive Product Range**: From a wide range of shades in their makeup products to the universal skincare line, Glossier's products aim to cater to every individual, irrespective of their skin type or tone.

#### Conclusion:
Glossier's rise can be attributed to its ability to tap into what Gen Z values in beauty: authenticity, inclusivity, and community. The brand has managed to position itself not just as a beauty brand but as a lifestyle choice for many Gen Z consumers, emphasizing real beauty and real people.
