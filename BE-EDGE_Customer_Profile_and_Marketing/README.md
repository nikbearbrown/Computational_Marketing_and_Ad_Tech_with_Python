# BE-EDGE Customer Profile and Marketing

The proposed idea is for the team to expand the BE-EDGE case study learning base aas it currently has only eight.

### üìò Enhancing Management Consulting Recruitment with Expanded Case Studies

Case interviews hold a unique and essential place in the recruitment process for management consulting roles. To enrich the BE-EDGE methodology, I propose expanding our repository of case studies, especially since BE-EDGE currently features a limited set of just eight.

> **üí° Note:** Associate Professor Nik Bear Brown is leading a team focused on an intriguing project that utilizes generative AI for the analysis and creation of management case studies.

#### üöÄ Action Steps:
1. **Case Analysis Review**: Team members should individually select and review one or two case analyses, rectifying any errors.
2. **Contribution to BE-EDGE**: These refined case studies could then be offered to BE-EDGE, augmenting their collection.
3. **Diverse Selection**: By allowing each team member to select case studies within their specialized domain, we can ensure a broader spectrum of topics on BE-EDGE.

#### üìÇ Directory Structure:
- The crafted case studies can be found in the `Case_Studies` subfolder.
  - Each case study resides in its dedicated subfolder.

# Generative AI for Management Case Study Analysis & Creation

## Objective
Develop a software tool that uses generative AI to interact with management case studies. The software must be able to provide feedback on users' analysis of existing case studies and generate new case studies based on different contexts and scenarios.

---

### 1. User Interface
- A user-friendly dashboard for uploading and analyzing management case studies.
- Fields for users to enter their analysis of the uploaded case study.
- A feedback section where generative AI provides feedback on the analysis.
- A feature to request the generation of new case studies based on specified parameters.

---

### 2. Case Study Analysis Feedback
- Ability to accept textual analysis from users regarding a specific case study.
- Use generative AI models to understand the content and context of the analysis.
- Provide feedback regarding the accuracy, depth, and quality of the analysis.
- Suggest areas of improvement or additional angles for consideration.

---

### 3. Generation of New Case Studies
- Users should be able to specify desired contexts and scenarios for new case studies.
- Use generative AI to produce detailed and realistic management case studies based on user specifications.
- Ensure the generated case studies are coherent, relevant, and follow the structural and stylistic norms of typical management case studies.
- Include options for users to download or share the generated case studies.

---

### 4. AI Training & Maintenance
- Use a comprehensive dataset of management case studies to train the generative AI models.
- Ensure periodic retraining and updating of the AI models to improve accuracy and relevance.
- Implement feedback loops where users can flag inaccuracies or issues, which can be used for further model refinement.

---

### 5. Security & Privacy
- Ensure secure data storage, with proper encryption protocols for user-uploaded case studies and analyses.
- Maintain user privacy by not storing personal identifiable information unless absolutely necessary.
- Allow users to opt-out of data collection processes, where their data might be used for further model improvement.

---

### 6. Performance & Scalability
- Ensure that feedback on user analysis is provided in real-time or near-real-time.
- Ensure the system can handle a large number of simultaneous users.
- Implement cloud scalability options to handle potential traffic spikes.

---

### 7. Testing & QA
- Implement rigorous testing processes, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.
- Ensure the AI's feedback and generated case studies are tested for accuracy and relevance.

---

### 8. Documentation & Support
- Provide detailed user documentation on how to use the software, including tutorials and FAQ sections.
- Offer technical support channels (e.g., chat, email) for users facing issues.
